Hi there!  I'm a software engineer at Omada Identity, always on the lookout for cool new tech to learn and share my discoveries with others. Writing about software development and contributing to open-source projects are some of my ways to spread the love.

When I'm not coding, you might find me catching a flick at the movies, taking a hike in the great outdoors, or getting lost in a good sci-fi book. I'm a total space geek, and even I've worked at a fireworks company! ðŸš€
